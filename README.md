# EE4C16

\[EE4C16\] is an introduction course to Machine Learning (ML), with a focus on
Deep Learning.  It is a fourth year module offered by the [Electronic &
Electrical Engineering](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/) department to the
undergraduate students of [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie).

Although Deep Learning has been around for quite a while, it has recently become
a disruptive technology that has been unexpectedly taking over operations of
technology companies around the world and disrupting all aspects of
society. When you read or hear about AI or machine Learning successes in the
news, it really means Deep Learning successes.

The course starts with an introduction to some essential aspects of Machine
Learning, including Least Squares, Logistic Regression and a quick overview of
some popular classification techniques.

Then the course dives into the fundamentals of Neural Nets, including Feed
Forward Neural Nets, Convolution Neural Nets, autoencoders and Recurrent Neural
Nets.

The material is constructed in collaboration with leading industrial
practitioners including Google, YouTube and Movidius, and students will have
guest lectures from these companies.
